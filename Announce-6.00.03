Hello,

Tcsh-6.00.03 is now available from tesla.ee.cornell.edu. 

Tcsh 6.00.03 now supports SVR4 machines (David Dawes),
has a full vi editor (Jose Souza), 
has emacs i-search functions (Per Hederland), 
supports imake (Marc Horowitz),
and can accept csh constructs in aliases.

For example:

> alias foo 'foreach i (\!$) \
echo $i \
end'

> foo 1 2 3
1 
2
